# **`Identifying and Recommending best Restaurants: Capstone project`:whale2:**
Successfully finished my Capstone project for Masters Program: Data Analyst from Simplilearn in collaboration with IBM.
The overall project is all about using data effectively to get the insights, so it could be moved for further stage i.e, Making a ML model.
So, in this I studied the data with all my knowledge and also with the help of instructor for the project, colleagues and as well as online tech community.
